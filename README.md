# Welcome to a game of Tic Tac Toe!
This app allows you to play both in one-player mode (against computer) and in two-player mode (against another user).<br>
The one-player mode is made to be unbeatable, but if you think you are the GOAT in tic tac tow, then you are free to try, by all means!<br><br>
The unbeatable tic tac toe mode is made using the famed Mini-Max algorithm which uses a concept of maximising or minimizing based on whether<br>
we choose the maximizer or minimizer to win. This works mainly on two-player games like chess, tic tac toe(this one), chomp, checkers, etc.
